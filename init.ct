** Init.fnl
This starts the compiler and publisher.

#+begin_src main
    #=compiler_lib
    #=publisher_lib

    (when (= (length arg) 1)
      (compiler (. arg 1) (publisher (. arg 1))))
#+end_src

** Local Dependencies
The first dependency is on the compiler. It is responsible
for writing the code to a compliable file.

#+begin_src compiler_lib
    (local compiler (require :lib.compiler))
#+end_src

The second dependency is on the publisher. It is
responsible for taking care of publishing the text file.

#+begin_src publisher_lib
    (local publisher (require :lib.publisher))
#+end_src
